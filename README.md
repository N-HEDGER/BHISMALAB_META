# Welcome to the BhismaLab meta-analysis resource!

This resource is designed to guide users through the process of conducting meta analysis with R. 

## Pre-requisites

You will need the following installed on your system:

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) / [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
2. The following R packages installed: metafor, ggplot2, metaSEM, compute.es, MBESS.
These packages can be installed via this line of code:

```r
install.packages(c("metafor","ggplot2","metaSEM","compute.es","MBESS"))
```

Note that this is not a guide on how to use R itself. There are very many [excellent guides](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) freely available to get you up and running with this. There is no requirement to be an 'expert' in R - you only need to understand the very basics (data frames, functions). 

## Approach

This resource consists of several chapters that will guide you through the various aspects of conducting a meta-analysis in R.
The chapters are in markdown format, with embedded code that you can copy and paste into your own R console.

You can view the first chapter [here](CH_01_Introduction.md). Below is a full index of chapters: 

### Index
| Chapter | Title |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | [Introduction](CH_01_Introduction.md) | 
| 2 | [Gathering Data](CH_02_Gathering_data.md) | 
| 3 | Creating and interacting with model objects |
| 4 | Testing the robustness of models |
| 5 | Publication bias |
| 6 | Moderator analysis | 
| 7 | Multi-level models |
